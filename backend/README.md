# Group Gate API using Django REST Framework

## Users

/api/users/

```json
{
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": "",
    "display_name": "",
    "groups": []
}
```

### User authentication

This generates a JWT token or refreshes it. Use in the format:

JWT <token>

api/auth/token/obtain/  OR   api/auth/token/refresh/

```json
{
    "username": "dakdo",
    "password": "dakdo"
}
```

### User ratings

Rate a user with an integer value (will update to 5-star rating).

/api/ratings/

```json
{
    "user":1
    "rating":3
}
```

## Groups

Create a group with existing users with an assigned role.

/api/groups/

```json
{
    "name": "x",
    "description": "x",
    "course":"CMPT470",
    "members": [{"user_id":1, "user_role":"dev"},{"user_id":2, "user_role":"dev"}],
    "owner": "3"
}
```

### Filter groups by course

Filters groups with course with CMPT470

GET
/api/groups/?course=CMPT470


### Filter groups by owner

Filter groups with owner id of 4

GET
/api/groups/?owner=4


## Invites

Allow a user to invite another to a group. The invite response is handled on another endpoint below.

/api/invites/

```json
{
    "from_user": 1,
    "to_user": 2,
    "group": 1,
    "status": 0
}
```

* status = 0 is no reply
* status = 1 is invite accepted (to_user will be automatically added to group)
* status = 2 is invite declined

NOTE: Status does not need to be supplied and is 0 by default (indicating no response)

Updates are not allowed

### Invite response

Accept or decline an invite.

/api/invites/<id>/response/

```json
{
	"response": true
}
```

POST only

This should be displayed for the user after the invite is sent out using the previous endpoint.
